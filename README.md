## Highway-Simulation

This highway simulation software package is developed in Python. To run the simulation, make sure you are using Python 2, and have required packages (TkInter and Matplotlib) installed.

For the checkpoint implementation, all modules have been developed and properly integrated. Source codes are included in the codes folder. To run the model and visualize the results, first ```cd ~/path/to/the/codes/folder```, then simply run the main script from command line ```python main.py``` or ```python2 main.py``` if you have multiple python versions.
